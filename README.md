# rpm-terraform-provider-esxi
Packaging Jonathan Senkerik's excellent terraform-provider-esxi for faster deployment and uptake

## Quickly:

Jonathan's excellent Terraform add-on is phenomenal as a tool for the rest of us to use and truck-about with, and then ultimately to complete that circle and start contributing back.  Some organizations Do Not Accept unpackaged, no-manifest software ('spraypaint') in their organization, and some of those organizations deploy on ephemeral or isolated machines with no os-Management connection.  Let's get over the implementation barrier with a ver-ry simple wrapper.  

1. manifest of hard checksums
1. 'perfect' removal and upgrade
1. consistent/repeatable environment

So, all the things we like and need.
